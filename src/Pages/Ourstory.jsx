            <p>When the Galaxy® brand launched in 1960 in Britain, we helped consumers choose a new kind of pleasure for the first time, bringing a modern, sophisticated chocolate to Britain. Our silky, finely-milled chocolate was revolutionary, setting the gold standard. That’s why everyone’s first bite of Galaxy® chocolate is so memorable. <br />

Ever since, we have strived to empower each new generation to choose pleasure too, right up to today’s consumers who juggle modern life. <br />

Each piece of rich, creamy Galaxy® chocolate is an expression of effortless pleasure, evolving along the way, and proving as timeless now as it was back in the 60s. <br />

</p>
<h2>How we craft our chocolate</h2>

 <p>Whether it’s the millions of Galaxy® Smooth Milk blocks purchased every year, or the bold and adventurous flavours of our new Fusions® product range, every Galaxy® product is carefully crafted to be savoured and enjoyed in a moment of pleasure. <br />
 ​
Our chocolatiers have spent years perfecting the elements of our Galaxy® products, with thousands of hours designing even the tiniest details, from the soft corners and undulating flow of our bar to the finely milled cocoa that makes every mouthful as silky as the last. <br />

​Through research, we have identified three distinct ‘stages of taste’ when enjoying a Galaxy® moment: <br />

1. The release of the signature taste of our Galaxy® products during the first bite. It is unmistakably smooth and creamy and has been loved by the nation for generations. <br />

2. The sustained presence of its characteristic caramel notes, as the silky Galaxy® chocolate slowly melts in your mouth. <br />

3. The distinctive pleasure of our Galaxy® products – that silky smooth flavour, lingering indulgently long after the chocolate experience, promoting a deep sense of relaxation. <br />

So next time you enjoy a piece of Galaxy® chocolate, why not linger over it a little longer, to ensure you unapologetically Choose a Pleasure that lasts?</p>
